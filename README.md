BGU-Flow is a web-based system to create chains of simple request, wait and block events, called flows.

A flow is triggered by changes that occur within other web services such as Gmail, Whatssap and Moodle. It may be triggered as well when the first event is a type of request - for example send email.

BGU-Flow enables to block events. For example if user doesn't want to send emails in the morning, the system will block the send email request untill the afternoon.

Example of a flow may send an e-mail message if the user have a new assignment in the moodle.

Simple to use, beautiful and intuitive UI, smooth UX. By using graph, the user can make a new flow by just drag and drop of event images and connecting them.

By using Behavioral Programming, creating the logic and the code of the flows is very easy without any if statement. As result, maintenance is very easy.

Additionally, BGU-Flow makes it easier for the student by helping him to get the most relevant information and by giving him the option to handle his homework's partners.
